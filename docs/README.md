#### Decentralized Data Layer for Web 3.0

Our goal is to decentralize the ability to provide data, interact with data to empower Decentralized app developers, provide tools that speed up the creation of Decentralized Applications, and drive adoption of blockchain technology.


When dealing with data security it is not enough to “trust”. Proxima provides the convenience, feature set, and speed of centralized providers **AND** maintains the audibility and security of the blockchain. Our solution is general enough to enable our decentralized data providers to provide data for decentralized applications for several blockchains / smart contract platforms, while basing our security on the consensus of the blockchain that the data is coming from.

### Examples

- _Did my user pay? What are the interest rates?_
- _How many users are there? What do my orders look like?_
- _What is my account balance? What transactions have I been a part of?_

*Blockchain data is tough to truly authenticate.*

How do you know that you are getting accurate and sound data from the correct blockchain? You have no idea if the data coming from your account balance, query, or decentralized application events are accurate and timely. The result can lead to major issues with visibility, analytics, and finances within your business. It can mean the difference between success or failure.
